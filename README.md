# Refactoring VBA Code and Measuring Performance

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

	The purpose of this analysis was to streamline and compress a large amount of stock data to present revenue returns.

Grading: the purpose and background are well defined

## Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Grading: The analysis is well described with screeshots and code

Tip: quote code using backticks, like `this`

## Summary

In a summary statement, address the following questions:

### Advantages of refactoring code

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

	Disadvantages would be initial setup labor, whereas the advantage would be lower execute times.

### Disadvantages of refactoring code

	Initial setup (ex. learning refractoring tools), and possible unexpected changes to code which require debugging, which is more labor

### Pros and Cons of refactoring the original VBA script

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Pros
- Potential increase in runtimes
- Potentially more concise/easy to read code
- Ease of future manipulation

Cons
- Refractoring wasn't necessary to begin with
- Upfront labor cost to refactor
- Potentially only minimal gains
